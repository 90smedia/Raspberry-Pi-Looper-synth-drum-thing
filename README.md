# Raspberry-Pi-Looper-synth-drum-thing
My first venture into raspberry pi stuff. Running a custom pure data patch I've been working on for a couple years on a Raspberry Pi 3. This project took a couple months and I'm still tweaking stuff here and there but it's pretty much complete, it even survived it's first live show!

I've left out the drum samples and Sessions directoroy. To add your own samples just add .wav files to the piLooper directory with names like:
kick_01.wav - kick_24.wav
hh_01.wav - hh_12.wav
snare_01.wav - snare_24.wav
crash_01.wav - crash_04.wav
Or change the sample names to whatever you want in the pd patch. 
The Sessions directory is pointed to where it lives on my pi, you will need to change that to wherever you are storing your patch on your pi.
